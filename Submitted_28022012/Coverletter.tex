\opening{\sffamily \vspace{-0.5cm} Dear Prof. Verma,}
\vspace{-0.3cm}
Please find enclosed our manuscript titled “Mutualism, evolutionary multiplayer games, and the Red King”.

Evolutionary game theory has become is one of the most successful modeling approaches in biology. 
%has exploded in the last few years. Multiplayer games involving social dilemmas have been attention grabbers in this evolving field. 
Our manuscript applies the recent theoretical developments in multiplayer evolutionary game theory to the idea of mutualistic interactions. 
Almost a decade ago Bergstrom and Lachmann published a paper in PNAS proposing a radical concept called “Red King effect” based on two player interactions, where the slowest runner runner can win the evolutionary race. 
Our manuscripts builds on that research but uses multiplayer games. 
This approach shows that in a more realistic setting the Red King effect can become weaker or stronger.
Moreover, we depict how such nonlinear properties of mutualistic relationships can be explored and how they can
shape the evolutionary outcome.

As a handling editor, we would like to propose Simon Levin, who is an authority in the field. 
%He has coauthored seminal papers on ecosystem dynamics and stability and 
We are convinced that the subject of the manuscript fits his domain of interest. %Therefore, he would be the perfect editor to handle a manuscript on this subject. 
An excellent alternative would be Lord Robert May, another leading scientists in theoretical ecology.

%As referees, we would like to propose:
%Redouan Bshary ( redouan.bshary@unine.ch )
%Michael Lachmann ( lachmann@eva.mpg.de )
%Francisco C. Santos ( franciscocsantos@ist.utl.pt )
%Corina Tarnita ( corina@math.harvard.edu )


We are confident that our manuscript is of interest for a broad audience and hope that you are able to consider our manuscript for publication in PNAS. 

%Thank you for your consideration.

With kind regards,\\
Arne Traulsen and Chaitanya S. Gokhale
